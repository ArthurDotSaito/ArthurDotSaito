<h1 align="center">Keep Moving Forward</h1>
Hey there! I'm Arthur Saito, a software developer and engineer (I'm mechanical engineer!). I'm continually involved in projects and exploring new technologies. Typically, I'm coding, ready to address new solutions, contribute to projects, and develop systems. I currently serve as a Software Architect at Nuria S.A and trying to complete my master's degree in UCL.
My current interests are: Compilers, Operating Systems and databases.

I'm an developer with experience in JavaScript/TypeScript with Node.js and object oriented languages such as C# and Java. I have a knowledge in popular libraries like React, Express and frameworks such as Angular, Next.js NestJS, .NET Framework and Spring. My proficiency extends to working with various databases, including MySQL, PostgresSQL, Redis, and MongoDB. Additionally, I am well-versed in infrastructure and cloud architecture tools, such as Consul, Istio, Docker, Kubernetes, Kong, Terraform and more. 

Sometimes I work with operational system tools, building simple compilers, memory meneagers and basic assembly kernels.
Sometimes I play with computer graphics with GLSL or WebGL.
